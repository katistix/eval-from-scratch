# eval-from-scratch

A simple "interpreter" that takes in as input simple arithmetic expressions and computes their values.

This is a **learning project**. It is supposed to teach me the following things:

-   how to build a **tokenizer**
-   how to compute a simple arithmetic expression
-   what is an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**

As I stated, this is _my_ learning journey. But I also try to document the code as much as possible to make it easier to understand for everyone.

## Current progress and features:

-   [x] Project structure setup and build system with CMake

-   [x] Tokenize the expression and return the `tokens` vector.

-   [ ] Build the expression tree

-   [ ] Compute simple arithmetic expressions with `+ - / *`

-   [ ] Implement parentheses `()`

-   [ ] Implement `floating point` numbers

-   [ ] Implement constants like `pi`, `e` etc.
